	["One day you finally knew
		what you had to do,
		and began,
		though the voices around you
		kept shouting
		their bad advice--
		though the whole house
		began to tremble
		and you felt the old tug
		at your ankles.\
		"Mend my life!\"
		each voice cried.
		", "
		But you didn 't stop.
		You knew what you had to do,
		though the wind pried
		with its stiff fingers
		at the very foundations,
		though their melancholy
		was terrible.
		", "
		It was already late
		enough, and a wild night,
		and the road full of fallen
		branches and stones.
		", "
		But little by little,
		as you left their voices behind,
		the stars began to burn
		through the sheets of clouds,
		and there was a new voice
		which you slowly
		recognized as your own,
		that kept you company
		as you strode deeper and deeper
		into the world,
		determined to do
			the only thing you could do --
				determined to save
			the only life you could save.

		JavaScript(\"JS\" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites. It was invented by Brendan Eich, co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation.", "You can do pretty much anything with JavaScript. You'll start small with simple features such as carousels, image galleries, fluctuating layouts, and responses to button clicks. Eventually as you get more experienced with the language, you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics, full blown database-driven apps, and more!", "JavaScript itself is fairly compact but very flexible, and developers have written a lot of tools on top of the core JavaScript language, to unlock a huge amount of extra functionality with very little effort. These include:", "Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing various functionality like dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles, grabbing and manipulating a video stream from the user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.", "Third-party APIs to allow developers to incorporate functionality in their sites from other properties, such as Twitter or Facebook.", "Third-party frameworks and libraries you can apply to your HTML to allow you to rapidly build up sites and applications."],
		["I'm artistically brokenhearted. I wanted to be a screen actor. I wanted to change the world through my sensitivity. But it was a very closed system in Italy. There are only like five movies per year. And there aren’t exactly auditions. You must be friends with the director to get a role. So I tried going to Britain. And that almost destroyed me", "I was always cast as a foreigner. Usually I was a Mafioso, but I played all types of foreigners. I’ve been a Spanish waiter, a Turkish waiter, and a French waiter. And they were always making me wear a mustache.", "So I tried for America. I applied for an extraordinary talent visa. It cost me $6,000. The application was the size of a book. I had to submit ten letters of recommendation to prove that I was extraordinary. What a scam that was.", "Nobody cares that I’m extraordinary. None of the television stations will audition people with this visa. Everyone wants to see a green card. I can only work on small productions. But things have gotten a little better.", "I’m getting some minor roles. I’m still playing gangsters. But sometimes I’m the funny gangster. Or the gangster with some sense. My next role is a scientist who turns into a zombie. In the movie, every stranger appears to be a zombie. But nobody is really a zombie. Strangers just seem like zombies. So, hey, there’s a moral message there."]
